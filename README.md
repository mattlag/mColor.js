# mColor.js
A small JavaScript object that takes a RGB color, then lightens it or darkens it using the LAB color space, then spits out RGB as a result.

Because RGB colors are routed through two different color spaces and back (RGB > XYZ > LAB) there are a few rounding errors, but it's usually around 2%.

Great for lightness-accurate gradients!
